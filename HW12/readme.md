# Homework 12
## Jordan Brist

I thought that this week would be super easy after the setup we did last week, but it actually gave me quite a bit of trouble. However, I think that most of my trouble came from my own mistakes in naming and making things more convoluted than they needed to be. I remembered what you said in the feedback for Homework 9 about installing Live Server in VS Code and I really wish I had done it sooner. It makes it so much easier to view changes on the fly. I always find myself changing a handful of different things and then when something doesn't work I have to go back and check everything, so having the live viewer should help me check more frequently so I don't have to sift through so much code. I couldn't quite figure out how to make the collectibles disappear when collected by the blue square.
