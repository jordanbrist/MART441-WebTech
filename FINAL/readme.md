# Final
## Jordan Brist

This class was very insightful. I am glad to have learned more about JavaScript and some of the libraries that make it simpler or more efficient to use. I think that the work that we did with JavaScript will help me with any future web design that I do as many of the foundational principles we learned will allow for greater functionality in web pages. 

For my final, I chose to re-visit Phaser. I used what I learned in Week 13 and used the basis of that selection of tutorials to create a simple version of Breakout. I ran into some trouble along the way that all ended up being due to some brackets being in the wrong places. Once I found that it was pretty smooth sailing.
