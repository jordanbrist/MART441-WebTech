This week looked like it was going to be fairly easy but I struggled with it more than I thought I would. I tried making a toString with multiple objects inside similar to the one used in the example from "An Example using Classes and Objects" on the website. However, I couldn't figure out how to get things to display properly so I opted to split it up.
