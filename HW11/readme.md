This week was fun, it reminded me of the p5.js work that we did in Creative Coding. It definitely wasn't as straightforward as p5.js, but it was easier to grasp than I thought it would be. I had some trouble when trying to create a boundary that would keep objects from being able to leave the canvas. I eventually came up with something that worked (albeit not very well) but I couldn't find a way to do it efficiently or neatly.
