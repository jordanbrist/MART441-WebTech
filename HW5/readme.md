# Homework 5
## Jordan Brist

This week wasn't too bad. I remember using arrays a lot towards the end of MART 120, so this was a nice refresher. I'm a bit anxious but also excited to build onto it and use the new things that we went over in this week's lesson. The only problem I had with this week's assignment was an error in my naming that caused half of the images to not show up, but it was a simple fix.
