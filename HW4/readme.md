# Homework 4
## Jordan Brist

This week was super challenging for me. It is hard for me to work with so many different things going on that look so similar. The screen looks like a jumble and it makes me miss mistakes that would be otherwise easy to spot, thus making troubleshooting take longer than it should have. The extra time spent going back and forth also made it hard to draw new images for each choice like I had planned. I would say that it feels unfinished. I'll probably try and add them at a later date, but only if I can find the time.
