This assignment went better than I expected, although I had a fair bit of trouble trying to come up with a deisgn that I liked for the site. I think that it turned out okay, but it definitely isn't my favorite. I think that I could have put more time and effort into it and am dissapointed that I couldn't come up with something better. The actual coding went better than I expected. I didn't need to reference much of the material from last semester because it is still somewhat fresh. The final last semester made mobile-first design feel much less intimidating. I do wish that I experimented a bit more with layout of the containers and text, or went with a more colorful palette, but I still think that it looks better than many of my previous sites so I am happy enough with it. Overall, this felt like a good way to get back into working with HTML and CSS after many weeks without it.
