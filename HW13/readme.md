This introduction to Phaser was pretty interesting. It's crazy to me how much one can actually do with JavaScript and I am amazed at all the new things that seem possible when using different libraries. I didn't really try to push the boundaries very much with this assignment because it was honestly a tad overwhelming just going through all the code and seeing how things work. There is so much to learn and do, and I didn't want to screw something up so bad that my code wouldn't run. So, I just kept things simple.
