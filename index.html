            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am majoring in Media Arts.</p>
            <p>I am planning on graduating in Fall 2022.</p>
            <p>I have no professional experience but I enjoy graphic design, digital art, animation, and photography. I hope to pursue a career that allows me to work with one of these interests.</p>

            <p>My ADHD makes it hard for me to stay interested in one certain thing for more than a couple months and, when I do find something that interests me, I go all in on that thing.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="addition2" class="text">
            <p>Lately, I have been trying to guide myself towards things that can help improve my previous or existing hobbies so that I can stay entertained without being unproductive.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="addition3" class="text">
            <p>Some recent examples include 3D printing and film photography. 3D printing allows me to also improve my 3D modeling skills and learn new tricks in software like blender and fusion360. Working with film makes me think more carefully about shot composition and forces me to make firm decisions on whether something is worth photographing.</p>
