Node.js seems very complex. I still don't think I understand what is going on when I'm using it. I had to rely heavily on the provided example because I couldn't get anything to work as intended. I think that I would need spend way more time working with it before I could ever use it for anything meaningful. I think that node.js would be very usefull in conjunction with the other things thatt we learned this semester. I'm sure that it would work well for something like the "choose your own adventure" game or some other game that relies on user input.
