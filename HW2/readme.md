This assignment was fairly straightforward. I didn't run into much trouble this week. I was a bit hesitant to get back into JavaScript after not touching it since Creative Coding, but working with the console log was pretty simple. The codecademy introduction set my mind at ease a bit, maybe javascript will be easier to pick up again than I thought. Also, I'd never used the console log before so this was a good introduction to it.
