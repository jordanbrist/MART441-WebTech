Three.js is super cool. I didn't know that there was such a versatile way to create 3d art and animation using JavaScript. I had some trouble with this assignment at first. My three.min.js file that I downloaded was incompatible with the OBJLoader that I had, so I just used the links from the tutorials and everything worked as intended. After that, I was able to get everything working more or less how I wanted. For this assignment, I used a 3D model of a GameBoy that I created in my 3D animation class last year.
